The Epics is an online webapp which enables companies to save their employee information in a very organized manner. Employee can save their data. The database administrator and employees can view, save and delete their data from the database according to their permission level. Each employee has a different level of permission in the database. One employee cannot view every details of another employee. Employee cannot delete data of another employee. One employee cannot change the data of another employee unless the employee is authorized to do so. Epics is passionate about its mission of transforming employee management services into online services through innovation.

They cannot afford her education. She works very hard to afford her education. She wants to be a software engineer. She wants to help her parents. She works in a restaurant as a cashier to pay for her college tuition. She does not have so much money to pay for the textbooks. She does not like textbooks which costs more than $100.

## Scenarios in which a user can use this app:
Evan is a senior undergraduate student at San Jose State University, majoring in computer science. He has finished all graduate requirements and is looking forward to graduating at the end of May. He decides to sell all his textbooks from the past for some cash to pay his student loan.
    As part of this, Evan finds over twenty old textbooks from the bookshelf, cleans the cover, removes any bookmarks, and takes a photo. He creates an account on the iBook platform and follows the instruction to sell a book by entering the name, ISBN, and subject. However, when a buyer places an order, Evan needs to mail his textbook on his own with the iBook platform's information. Evan searches online for the nearest mail service. Google Map suggests that there are few UPS and FedEx stores within 5 miles of his address. As mail services are not integrated with the iBook platform, he manages to mail his book through UPS.

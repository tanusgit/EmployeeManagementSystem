# Project: Epics Employee managment webapp

## Requirements: 
The Epics web app is to help employers to save their employee details in an organized way.

## Vision statement: 
The Epics is an online webapp which enables companies to save their employee information in a very organized manner. Employee can save their data. The database administrator and employees can view, save and delete their data from the database according to their permission level. Each employee has a different level of permission in the database. One employee cannot view every details of another employee. Employee cannot delete data of another employee. One employee cannot change the data of another employee unless the employee is authorized to do so. Epics is passionate about its mission of transforming employee management services into online services through innovation.

## Suitable users for this web app:
Erik is an employee of a small startup. The number of employees are increasing in his comapny. He was using exel sheet to save the employee information. But with the growing number of employee it is getting difficult for him to manage information. He is unable to understand how to search for a specific employee based on his income or street address as the excel sheet became so big that he cannot find the employee. He has to scrol down a lot to find the employee. He is getting very upset about this. He is unable to find employees based on specific criteria. He is unable to perform his job well. He is scared to loose his job due to his inefficiency at work.

## Scenarios in which a user can use this app:
Evan is a senior database administrator at a small company. He had around 10 people working in his company. He was comfortable maitaining the database on a excel sheet. His company recently got a lot of funding and they decided to hire 100 people for the comapny. The company also decided to give extra benefits to the emmployees like foodstamps and vision care. Evan now has to save more information about each company. It is getting difficult for Evan to store all the information of each employee in the database as he was using an excel sheet. He realized that he needs an efficient way to retrieve and save the details of each employee. He creates an account on the Epics which allows his to create his own database. Then he saves all the infomation of the employee. He creates and manages the rights of the employee in the database. based on the employee level each employee has a different levelof authorization in the database. It is very easy for Evan to maintain the database on Epics.
